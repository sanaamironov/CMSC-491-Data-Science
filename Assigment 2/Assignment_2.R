### Run the following R code and add code/commented answers where prompted
install.packages("tidyverse")

######################################## 1. #############################################
myVar = "83"

# Write the code that changes myVar to an integer data type. Assign the output to myVar.
myVar = as.integer(myVar) 

# Check the class of myVar
class(myVar)

######################################## 2. #############################################
# Create a vector named NumVec1 with the following entries -1, 4.5, 9, 10, 3
NumVec1 <- c(-1, 4.5, 9, 10, 3)

# Create a vector named NumVec2 with the following entries -5, 10, -2, 20, 3
NumVec2 <- c(-5, 10, -2, 20, 3)

# Write the code that calculates the sum of NumVec1 and NumVec2
sum= NumVec1+NumVec2

# Write the relational expression that checks where NumVec1 is greater than NumVec2
NumVec1 > NumVec2

# Write the relational expression that finds where NumVec1 has the same value as NumVec2
NumVec1 == NumVec2

# Update the NumVec1 vector to equal 1 if NumVec1 is less than 5
# and 0 if NumVec1 is greater than or equal to 5
NumVec1[NumVec1<5] <- 1
NumVec1[NumVec1>=5] <-0

# Print the the NumVec1 vector to check your results
# Hint: NumVec1 should now be [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
print(NumVec1)

########################################## 3. #############################################
TextVar = "MIS 431"
Data = c(3, 7, 4.5, 9, 4, 5.67)

# Write an IF statement that prints "MIS 431 is assigned to TextVar" if TextVar is equal to "MIS 431"
if (TextVar == "MIS 431"){
  print("MIS 431 is assigned to TextVar")
}
  
# Write an IF-ELSE statement that prints "The mean is less than 5" if the mean of the 
# Data vector is less than 5, or prints "The mean is greater than or equal to 5" if not
# Hint: the mean() function calculates the mean of a vector

if(mean(Data) < 5){
  print("The mean is less than 5")
} else{
  print("The mean is greater than or equal to 5")
}

# Write a FOR loop that prints the square root of the elements in the Data vector
# the sqrt() function calculates the square root of a number
for (variable in Data) {
  print(sqrt(variable))
 
}


########################################## 4. #############################################
myList = list(Gender = c("M", "F"),
              Age = c(26, 24),
              City = c("Catonsville","Towson"))

# Write the code that gives the mean of the Age vector in myList
mean(myList$Age)

# Write the code that gives the second element of the City vector in myList
myList$City[2]

# Write the code that gives the value of City in myList that corresponds to a value of "M" in Gender
myList$City[1]

########################################## 5. #############################################
myDataframe = data.frame(Model = c("Toyota","Honda","Ford"),
                         mpg = c(34, 33, 22),
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Write the command that gives the first row, second column of myDataframe
myDataframe$Model[1]


# Write the command that gives the average of the mpg column in myDataframe
mean(myDataframe$mpg)


# Write the command that gives the Model value that corresponds to an mpg value of 22 in myDataframe
myDataframe$mpg[3]

################################# Question 6 ############################################

# Run the code below to import the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Fill in the correct path to the Tipping Data.txt file on your computer
# Remember to end your file path with Tipping Data.txt (the name of the file)
# Separate parts of your path with "/" 

Tipping = read_tsv(file = 'Tipping Data.txt' )

# Now you should have a data frame, Tipping, available in your R session
# Run the code below to see what's stored in Tipping
# Tipping contains customer tipping data for a California restaurant
glimpse(Tipping)


################################# Question 7 ############################################

# We will be using dplyr functions to answer Question 7
# Here is an example of what I expect your answer to be

# Example question: Use filter() to subset the Tipping data
# to contain only Male customers.

# Your answer should be:
filter(Tipping, sex == "Male")

# Use filter() to subset the Tipping data
# to contain only Male customers who ate dinner on Saturday or Sunday

# Hint: the "day" variable gives the day a customer ate at the restuarant
# the "time" variable gives whether the meal was Dinner or Lunch


# Enter your code below:
filter(Tipping, (( day == "Sun" | day == "Sat" ) & (sex == "Male") & (time == "Dinner") ) )



# Use filter() to subset the Tipping data
# to contain only customers that tipped more than 6 dollars

# Hint: the "tip" variable contains the dollar amount that a 
# customer left as tip

# Enter your code below:
filter(Tipping, (tip>6))


# Use arrange() to sort the Tipping data frame
# by total_bill and then by tip, both in DESCENDING order

# Enter your code below:
arrange(Tipping,desc(total_bill) )
arrange(Tipping,desc(tip) )


################################# Question 8 ############################################

# Use select() to select the first 2 columns of Tipping

# Enter your code below:
select(Tipping,1:2)

# Use select() to select columns that contain the lower case letter "s"


# Enter your code below:
select(Tipping,contains('s'))

# Use summarise() to obtain the average tip amount
# Assign the result to a variable called "AvgTip" within the summarise function
 

# Enter your code below:
summarise(Tipping, AvgTip = mean(tip) )

# Enter the numeric value that you got from the code above, what's the average tip amount?
# Your answer: 
3.00

################################# Question 9 ############################################

# For question 9, you will need to use the %>% operator for your answers

# Use group_by() and summarise() to obtain the average tip by customer gender
# Assign the results to a variable named AvgTip, just like you did above

# Hint: Your code should look like this: Tipping %>% group_by() %>% summarise()
# Just fill in the correct input 

# Enter your code below:
Tipping %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(AvgTip = mean(tip))

# From the results above, which gender has higher tips, on average? Just enter male or female.
# Your answer: 
Male
# Use mutate() to compute a variable called TipPercent which equals tip/total_bill
# Hint, fill in the correct input: Tipping %>% mutate()

# Enter your code below:
Tipping %>% mutate(TipPercent= (tip/total_bill))


# Now extend the analysis above: Use a combination of mutate(), group_by(), and summarise()
# to compute the average tip percent by customer gender. Assign the results to TipPercent 
# within the mutate() function, just like above, and AvgTipPct
# within the summarise() function

# Hint: mutate() first, then group_by(), then summarise(), use the %>% operator
# Within summarise, you need to input AvgTipPct = mean(). What should go inside the mean() function?

# Enter your code below:
Tipping %>% mutate(TipPercent= (tip/total_bill)) %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(AvgTipPct = mean(TipPercent))


################################# Question 10 ############################################

# Write the R code that uses ggplot2 to produce a histogram
# of the tip variable in Tipping
# Set the color of the bars to "blue", and the border
# of the bars to "white"
# Add an appropriate title and x/y axis labels

# Enter your code below:
library(ggplot2)
tipDF= data.frame(Tipping$tip)
names(tipDF)[1]<-"Tip"
ggplot(data= Tipping ,mapping = aes(Tipping$tip)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30,color="white", fill="blue")+ labs(title = "Tip Histogram",x="Tip Ammount", y="Number of Customers")
